# onepager.js

Onepager.js will turn your markup into a onepage scrollable application with a dynamic navigation, API, callbacks and a mobile version. It's written in pure JS (es6) so you will have to compile it if you worry about older browsers. It has 2 dependencies:

- [in-view.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/in-view)
- [smooth-scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smooth-scroll)

## Install & usage

### from the terminal

npm install onepager.js
```

### in your js
```javascript
import OnePager from 'onepager.js'
const yourInstance = new OnePager()
import './node_modules/onepager.js/dist/css/onepager.min.css' // or import it in your css
```
